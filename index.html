	 <p>Hi I'm Ivan (or K-avi)! I'm a CS student in M2 at Sorbonne Universite in France. I'm Interested in systems and embedded programming,
		 SIMD and related topics :)
	 </p> 
	 <p>I mostly code in C. I'll use Python when I have to do data analysis and plots. I can also use 
		 bash for scripting stuff. I'm slowly getting into C++ and I'd like 
	 to learn Rust at some point.</p>

	<p>At the moment this page is an index with links to the different projects I've worked 
	on! Feel free to check them out!</p>
     <h1 class="text-center">Learn more about :</h1>

    <ul>
	<li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/MusicTool" target="_blank">MusicTool</a>  my first ever project. 
	It's a command line tool to perform musci theory oriented operations.</li>        
        <li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/siasl2" target="_blank">(SIASL)²</a> the acronym for 
	(Siasl Is a Silly Language)² which is the abriged version of (Siasl Is A Silly Language) . (Siasl Is a Silly Language) is a
	silly language. It's an overdesigned turing tarpit if such a thing is even possible.</li>  
	<li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/heapfuck" target="_blank">Heapfuck</a> a small binary heap based 
		turing tarpit</li>
	<li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/fibofuck" class="text-justify" target="_blank">Fibofuck</a> a fun 
	fibonacci heap based turing tarpit</li> 
	<li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/protesting_on_graphs" target="_blank">Protesting On Graphs</a> 
	a project I worked on during my internship at LIP6 in the 
	summer of 2023. It's a program to make simulations of walkers on graphs.</li>  
       	<li><a href="https://github.com/K-avi/edgerunner" target="_blank">Edgerunner</a> 
	A command line rogue like built with ncurses. The main idea of the game is that the 
	maze is actually a planar graph :)
	</li> 	
	<li><a href="https://github.com/fur0rem/lsrt" target="_blank">Link Stream Robustness Tester</a> 
	A group project I've worked on with <a href="https://github.com/Fur0rem/" target="_blank">Fur0rem</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dassire" target="_blank"> dassire</a> . The project was part of a college course. It's goal 
	is to implement a way to measure the robustness of a Link Stream (a linkstream is a way
	to represent a temporal network see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04073" target="_blank">this paper</a> 
	for more informations).
	</li>   
	<li><a href="https://github.com/K-avi/shadimem" target="_blank">Shadimem</a> 
	A group project I've worked on with <a href="https://github.com/pigeonsownme-temp" target="_blank">PigeonsOwnMe</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yoyolejojo" target="_blank"> yoyolejojo</a> .
	The project was part of a college course. It's goal 
	was to implement a Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) in C with unix sockets!
