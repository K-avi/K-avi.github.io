	 <p>Hi I'm Ivan (or K-avi)! I'm an undergrad CS student at Sorbonne Universite in France. I'm Interested in topics such as Graph Theory , 
	language theory (and compilers) and theoretical computer science. I'm not very knowledgeable yet but I'm eager to learn :) 
	 </p> 
	 <p>I mostly code in C. I'll use Python when I have to do data analysis and plots. I'd like to get into Rust , Haskell or Ocaml, Clisp and Fstar at some 
	 point.</p>

	<p>At the moment this page is an index with links to the different projects I've worked 
	on! Feel free to check them out!</p>
     <h1 class="text-center">Learn more about :</h1>

    <ul>
	<li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/MusicTool" target="_blank">MusicTool</a>  my first ever project. 
	It's a command line tool to perform musci theory oriented operations.</li>        
        <li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/siasl2" target="_blank">(SIASL)²</a> the acronym for 
	(Siasl Is a Silly Language)² which is the abriged version of (Siasl Is A Silly Language) . (Siasl Is a Silly Language) is a
	silly language. It's an overdesigned turing tarpit if such a thing is even possible.</li>  
	<li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/heapfuck" target="_blank">Heapfuck</a> a small binary heap based 
		turing tarpit</li>
	<li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/fibofuck" class="text-justify" target="_blank">Fibofuck</a> a fun 
	fibonacci heap based turing tarpit</li> 
	<li><a href="https://k-avi.github.io/protesting_on_graphs" target="_blank">Walking On Graphs</a> 
	a project I worked on during my internship at LIP6 in the 
	summer of 2023. It's a program to make simulations of walkers on graphs.</li>  
       	<li><a href="https://github.com/K-avi/edgerunner" target="_blank">Edgerunner</a> 
	A command line rogue like built with ncurses. The main idea of the game is that the 
	maze is actually a planar graph. It's still in developpement but you can play the beta :)
	</li> 	
	<li><a href="https://github.com/fur0rem/lsrt" target="_blank">Link Stream Robustness Tester</a> 
	A group project I'm currently working on. The project is part of a college course. It's goal 
	is to implement a way to measure the robustness of a Link Stream (a linkstream is a way
	to represent a temporal network see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04073" target="_blank">this paper</a> 
	for more informations).</li>
